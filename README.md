Memory game


Make a game of memory that has the following functionalities: player at the beginning chooses whether the board is going to be 4x5 or 5x4. After that characters are being randomly placed (it is desirable for characters to be numbers) and the table with chosen characters is shown for 15 seconds, after that all of the characters are masked. User inputs the wanted coordinates (for example AA if he wants to reveal the first field) and then the second one, and if the characters are paired the selected pair stay revealed, otherwise both become masked after 5 seconds. Game is over when all the characters are revealed.
